Not long ago, I knew nothing about coding. I've been doing work that I didn't enjoy and that wasn't interesting to me for the entirety of my adult life. It has consisted of working in the medical field for most of the past 8 years, and going to school to become a doctor. After completing all the prerequisites, getting good grades, job shadowing, gaining experience in the field, I just couldn't bring myself to apply. I decided I would rather do anything but work in a hospital setting any longer. 

So I decided to try new things. Coding was suggested to me by my girlfriend, who is a far more interesting and knowledgable person that I will ever be! I didn't know much about it, but began doing a little research online. Fate would have it that I stumbled upon Flatiron school. I tried it for a little bit, doing the free bootcamp. Then I quit after a couple weeks, continuing to work at a job I didn't enjoy. A few months later, I revisited the program. This time I stuck with it. I applied for the paid web-developer program and got in, so now I have to stick with it =) I'm enjoying the process, and the many challenges along the way. I find it frustrating at times, but when things click after many failed attempts and struggles, it's a great feeling and motivation to keep going. 

I'm completing the online program part-time, while subsequently completing an apprenticeship with the CDC for the next two year in Public Health. I hope that the many gifts of this program and the wonderful community will serve me and help me to serve others well beyond completion of this program. Whether I incorporating coding into a career in public health, or use a background in public health to drive a career in software development, I am excited for the journey ahead.
